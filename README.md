Switch instantly between two tab "worlds"â€”Work and Personalâ€”without losing context, clutter, or memory. Click the extension icon to teleport between your focused workspace and your everyday browsing.

ðŸŒŸ Key Features

Dual Tab Sets

    Work Mode: Save and close personal tabs, then instantly open your work tabs (docs, trackers, research).

    Personal Mode: Return to your casual browsing setup exactly as you left it.

Zero Memory Footprint

    Tabs from the other mode are fully closedâ€”not suspendedâ€”so they use zero CPU or RAM.

    When you switch, tabs reload fresh from their URLsâ€”nothing stays in memory.

One-Click Toggle

    One click saves current tabs, closes them, and opens the alternate set.

    3-second cooldown prevents accidental double-toggles.

Persistent Storage

    Only URLs are saved locally and securely. Nothing leaves your machine.

    Sessions persist indefinitely by reloading the saved URLs.

Zero-Configuration Setup

    No menus or setup needed. Install, open your tabs, click to toggle.

    Works immediately on any Firefox profile with minimal permissions.

Open Source

    Fully open-source. Our GitHub organization is isekaidetectiveagency.
